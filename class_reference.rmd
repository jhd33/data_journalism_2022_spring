## Introduction

Consider this a personal guide to the commands and functions you will learn. In general, when you come across an R command or function that you want to remember, put it in here along with a description of what it does and when you'd use it.


## Things I learned today on Jan 26th. 

The command to set a working directory is setwd(). For example: 

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/data_journalism_2022_spring")
```
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

How to find the number of how many NAs there are 

```{r}
filter(is.na(forgiveness_date)) %>%
```
